<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Impact allows partners to search and filter for products they wish to promote, very similar to most e-commerce websites. Using product data as well as data collected from partner behaviour. The goal of the project was to build a product recommendation system that recommends appropriate products to a user based on the product that they are currently viewing. Alongside a product recommendation are a few metrics that infer how accurate the product recommendation is.
